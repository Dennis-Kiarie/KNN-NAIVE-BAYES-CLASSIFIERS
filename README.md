# KNN-NAIVE-BAYES-CLASSIFIERS 

To implement K-nearest neighbor and  Naive Bayes Classifier. Conduct Experiment and calculate metrics

This is a predictive data analysis to design two a models i.e First model will predict if a passenger onboard servived or not and the Second model will assist in predicting if an Email is spam or not.The data used in predicting is extracted from two data sources i.e

# Description

Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20 sets.

For dataset 1, because we don't have the label for the test set, we will use the train set to create train and test data (i.e. splitting further), then perform K-nearest neighbor classification.

For dataset 2, perform classification of the testing set samples using the Naive Bayes Classifier.

Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).

Report the confusion matrix of each classifier.

Repeat step 1 to step 3 twice, each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40, then note the outcomes of your modeling.

Suggest and apply at least one of the optimization techniques that you learned earlier this week.

Provide further recommendations to improve both classifiers
